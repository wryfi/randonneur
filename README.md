# Randonneur

Randonneur is a frontend to [mountaineer](https://github.com/wryfi/mountaineer).

## Architecture

Randonneur is built on [cerebral](https://cerebraljs.com) and
[inferno](https://infernojs.org). Inferno is very similar to react, and
cerebral provides a global state tree for managing application state.
