# Randonneur

Randonneur is a frontend to [mountaineer](https://github.com/wryfi/mountaineer).

## Architecture

Randonneur is built on [cerebral](https://cerebraljs.com) and
[react](https://reactjs.org).

## Getting Started
The author is still learning how all this javascript stuff works.

Start by running `npm install` in the source directory.  When node finishes
installing packages, you should be able to run `npm start`, and a web server
should spin up, and launch the app in your default browser.
